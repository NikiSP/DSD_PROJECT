CLKC-55#1 Advisory
MMCME3 with global clock driver has no LOC  
The MMCME3_ADV cell pll_main/inst/mmcme3_adv_inst CLKIN1 or CLKIN2 pin is driven by global Clock buffer(s) clk_ref_BUFG_inst and does not have a LOC constraint. It is recommended to LOC the MMCM and use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint on the net(s) driven by the global Clock buffer(s).
